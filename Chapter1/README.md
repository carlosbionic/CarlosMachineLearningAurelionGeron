# Chapter 1

1. **Machine Learning** is the science to design and make programs that have the ability to learn from data. This systems can learn without being explicitly programmed.

2. Four types of problems where Machine Learning shines:
    * Classifying types of flowers or plants.
    * Predicting the stock prices (regression).
    * Make an app that recognizes voices.
    * Mailing spam filter.
    
3. A **labeled training set** is the data used for training the model, which has predefined *labels* (solutions). Each instance has the solution, called *label*. This is used in **Supervised learning**.

4. The two most common supervised tasks are *classification* (spam filter) and *regression* (predict a target numeric value).

5. Unsupervised tasks (unlabeled data):
    * Clustering.
    * Anomaly detection and novelty detection.
    * Visualization and dimensionality reduction.
    * Assosiation rule learning.
    
6. **Reinforcement learning**.

7. A *clustering* algorithm can be used to segment users/customers into multiple groups.

8. Spam detection problem is a *supervised* learning problem, since the training set is *labeled* (each feature is labeled as *spam* or *not spam*). It is a *classification* task.

9. In an online learning system the training can be done sequentially when new data is available, without the need to run all the data from scratch.

10. Out-of-core learning is done when the dataset is too big, or cannot fit in the machine's memory. The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats until the whole data is processed.

11. **Instance-based learning** relies on a *similarity measure*.

12. An algorithm's hyperparameter controlls the amount of regularization to apply during learning. Unlike a model's parameter, the hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm, and not of the model.
